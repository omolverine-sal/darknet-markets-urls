Looking for a **darknet market url** that just *works*, with fair rules and a real sense of order? I landed on **We The North**, and honestly, I’m impressed.

## “Nexus: Built for Trust, Not Just for Hype”
*by “TorontoVendor87”*

After Empire and Apollon vanished, I was skeptical about trying new darknet markets. Nexus changed my mind. What stood out? The marketplace uses a true escrow system – no coins in/out without order confirmation, which is the best anti-scam measure. Vendors can’t share external contact info, and admins kick out any shady actors fast.

Honestly, customer support is active 24/7, and the vendor dashboard gives me transparency about every order. Feedback seems unfiltered, which means you get the raw truth before you buy or sell.
